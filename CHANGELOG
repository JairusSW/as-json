v0.8.2 - Properties starting with `static` or `private` would be ignored
v0.8.3 - Dirty fix to issue #68. Add __JSON_Stringify callable to global scope.

v0.8.5 - Fix #73. Support for nullable primatives with Box<T> from as-container
v0.8.6 - Fix. Forgot to stash before publishing. Stash and push what should have been v0.8.5
