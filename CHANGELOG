# Change Log

## 2025-01-31 - 1.0.0-alpha.3

- fix: write to proper offset when deserializing string with \u0000-type escapes
- fix: simplify and fix memory offset issues with bs module
- fix: properly predict minimum size of to-be-serialized schemas
- fix: replace as-test with temporary framework to mitigate json-as versioning issues
- fix: fix multiple memory leaks during serialization
- feat: align memory allocations for better performance
- feat: achieve a space complexity of O(n) for serialization operations, unless dealing with \u0000-type escapes

## 2025-01-20 - 1.0.0-alpha.2

- fix: disable SIMD in generated transform code by default
- fix: re-add as-bs dependency so that it will not break in non-local environments
- fix: remove AS201 'conversion from type usize to i32' warning
- fix: add as-bs to peer dependencies so only one version is installed
- fix: point as-bs imports to submodule
- fix: remove submodule in favor of static module
- fix: bs.ensureSize would not grow and thus cause memory faults
- fix: bs.ensureSize triggering unintentionally

## 2025-01-20 - 1.0.0-alpha.1

- feat: finish implementation of arbitrary data serialization and deserialization using JSON.Value
- feat: reinstate usage of `JSON.Box<T>()` to support nullable primitive types
- feat: eliminate the need to import the `JSON` namespace when defining a schema
- feat: reduce memory usage so that it is viable for low-memory environments
- feat: write to a central buffer and reduce memory overhead
- feat: rewrite the transform to properly resolve schemas and link them together
- feat: pre-allocate and compute the minimum size of a schema to avoid memory out of range errors
